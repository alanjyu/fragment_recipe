# Supplementary material for "A recipe for continental fragment formation: big data analysis of rift models"

This is repository of the ASPECT parameters and Python scripts used for the initial model setup. 

The [overview.xlsx](https://github.com/alanjyu/fragment_recipe/blob/main/overview.xlsx) provides a list of tested models and calculations for the initial geotherm and material constant under various strength parameters ($f$).

The Python scripts used to calculate initial continental geotherm and yield strength envelope are stored in [py/](https://github.com/alanjyu/fragment_recipe/tree/main/py). The pvPython script used to detect continental fragments and analyze their widths is stored in [pvpy/](https://github.com/alanjyu/fragment_recipe/tree/main/pvpy). The ASPECT input parameter file for the reference model is stored in [prm/](https://github.com/alanjyu/fragment_recipe/tree/main/prm).
