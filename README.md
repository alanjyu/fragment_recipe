# Supplementary material for "A recipe for exotic continental fragment formation: automated data analysis of rift models"

This is a repository of the ASPECT input parameter files and Python scripts used for the initial model setup and model analysis. 

The [overview.xlsx](https://github.com/alanjyu/fragment_recipe/blob/main/overview.xlsx) provides a list of tested models, as well as calculations for the initial geotherm and material constant under various strength parameters ($f$).

The Python scripts used to calculate the initial geotherm and yield strength of the continent are stored in [py/](https://github.com/alanjyu/fragment_recipe/tree/main/py). The pvPython script used to detect continental fragments and analyze their width is stored in [pvpy/](https://github.com/alanjyu/fragment_recipe/tree/main/pvpy). The ASPECT input parameter file for the reference model, as well as its movie render and log files, is stored in [prm/](https://github.com/alanjyu/fragment_recipe/tree/main/prm).
