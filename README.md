# Supplementary material for "A recipe for continental fragment formation: big data analysis of rift models"

This is repository of the ASPECT parameters and Python scripts used for the initial model setup. 

The [overview.xlsx]() provides a list of tested models and calculations for the initial geotherm and material constant under various strength parameters $(f)$.

The initial continental geotherm and yield strength envelope are stored in [/py](https://github.com/alanjyu/fragment_recipe/tree/main/py). The ASPECT input parameter file for the reference model is stored in [/prm](https://github.com/alanjyu/fragment_recipe/tree/main/prm).
